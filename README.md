# TODO:

check before launch:
// -- add maximum pdf size per prompt when generating text so we do not exceed AI limit per prompt
// -- check if all components are server components if possible
// -- check if there is better retry logic when calling the AI
// -- check if there is better way to add chunking text prompt
// -- check if all routes are covered with the fallback and if URL security is enough

-- remove pdfItems from getLessonData, these need to be separated
-- check why uploading calls 3 requests and is so slow ///
-- create suspense component for pending and error state
-- retry test first flashes the test then loads loader

-- check if permisions for tests are needed so we avoid scenario where anyone can access other peoples tests


PRE OVOGA MORAS POCISTITI SVE STO STOJI U NAPOMENAMA GORE
-- Add delete and edit
-- add modals on all needed actions
-- maybe add settings page
-- Add analytics
-- add payments
-- check free tier plan and work out permisions and free plan

MAYBE IN FUTURE
-- in settings page add TEST SETTINGs (setting up if user wants all questions on one page, or he wants pagination)
-- in settings page add TEST SETTINGS (if user wants to have only one question true when multiple questions)
-TEST GENERATION
-- add additional prompt section to test generation so user can add additional instruction for test
-- add importing previous tests when generating test so AI knows not to generate same questions
--  add dashboard for number of lessons, pass rate, total tests, test review in one of the navigation to single class page
-- implement custom question number per lesson
-- add abort test generating when clicking on the X in the loader
-- maybe add sharing tests between user as a social media app

FUTURE FEATURES:
- test sharing between users and groups
- test preview before starting to work on it
- audio lessons

# Teach-me core features and strategie

## Core Differentiating Features
These will set Teach.me apart from competitors and make it valuable for students.

1. AI-Powered Test Generation (Unique Twist)

✅ Upload PDFs → AI understands the content → Generates structured quizzes, flashcards, and practice tests.

💡 Enhancements: 

Difficulty Scaling – AI adapts questions to user progress (e.g., easier first, harder later).
Smart Answer Explanations – AI provides detailed explanations instead of just "Correct" or "Wrong."
Multiple Testing Modes – MCQs, fill-in-the-blanks, short answers, and AI-generated essay topics.


2. Study Timeline & Smart Scheduling

✅ AI analyzes uploaded materials → Creates a personalized study plan based on exam dates & learning pace.

💡 Enhancements:

Calendar Integration – Sync study schedule with Google Calendar.
Adaptive Learning – If a user struggles with certain topics, the AI re-prioritizes them in the schedule.
Reminder System – Smart notifications for "Revision Time" and "Test Yourself Today."


3. Voice-Powered Learning (AI Voice from PDFs)

✅ AI reads PDFs aloud but does more than basic text-to-speech.

💡 Enhancements:

Structured Audio Lessons – AI summarizes key topics before reading.
Interactive Mode – AI asks questions mid-way through to keep users engaged.
Voice Commands – "Pause," "Summarize this section," "Give me a quiz on what I just heard."
🔹 Competitor Gap: Other apps just read text aloud; this would make it interactive & educational.


4. AI-Powered Smart Notes & Summarization

✅ AI extracts key points from PDFs → Converts them into bullet points & flashcards.

💡 Enhancements:

Auto Highlighting – AI marks important sections in user-uploaded PDFs.
Context-Aware Flashcards – AI automatically creates Q&A pairs based on key concepts.
🔹 Competitor Gap: Quizlet requires manual input, but Teach.me auto-generates study materials.
📚 Collaboration & Sharing Features
Features to encourage social learning and expand user engagement.


5. Multi-User Class Collaboration

✅ Users can create & share classes with friends or study groups.

💡 Enhancements:

Live Study Sessions – Users can take quizzes together in real-time and compare scores.
AI-Suggested Study Buddies – AI matches students with similar subjects & learning styles.
Leaderboard & Challenges – Gamify learning with points & rewards.
🔹 Competitor Gap: Google Classroom is teacher-led, but Teach.me is student-driven.


6. AI Study Assistant (Chat-Based)

✅ Built-in AI chatbot that answers questions from uploaded materials.

💡 Enhancements:

PDF-Specific Q&A – "Explain Chapter 3 in simple terms" or "Give me a summary of this section."
Personalized Learning Tips – AI suggests learning techniques based on past performance.

🔹 Competitor Gap: ChatGPT exists, but it doesn’t connect directly to user materials like Teach.me would.


7. Progress Tracking & Analytics

✅ Track test scores, study time, and weak areas needing improvement.

💡 Enhancements:

Smart Reports – AI analyzes user performance & suggests focus areas.
Confidence Level Indicator – Users rate their confidence before & after each test to see improvement.
Streaks & Badges – Encourage consistency (e.g., "You studied 5 days in a row!").

🔹 Competitor Gap: Most study apps track progress manually; Teach.me automates it.

## 💰 Monetization Strategy

To stay competitive while covering AI & storage costs, you could use:

Freemium Model

🔹 Free Tier – 5-10 free PDFs, limited AI quiz generations per month.

🔹 Premium Tier ($5-10/month) – Unlimited uploads, AI tests, smart notes, and voice learning.

🔹 Pay-Per-Use Option – One-time payment for extra AI features without full subscription.


## 🚀 Final Competitive Advantage
✅ AI-Powered Everything – Not just test generation, but smart summarization, interactive voice learning, and study scheduling.

✅ Student-Centered Collaboration – Unlike Google Classroom, this is built for students, not teachers.

✅ Unique AI Study Tools – Voice learning, chatbot, and adaptive study plans make it smarter than Quizlet.

✅ Gamification & Social Learning – Keeps students motivated and engaged.
