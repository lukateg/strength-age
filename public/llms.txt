## About StrengthAge

StrengthAge is a free, evidence-based strength age assessment platform designed specifically for seniors aged 55+. Our mission is to make validated fitness testing accessible to older adults so they can monitor their functional capacity and take proactive steps toward healthy aging.

## What is a Strength Age Test?

A strength age test compares your functional fitness to others your age using validated assessments. Our test estimates your "strength age" - which may be higher or lower than your actual age - based on:

- 30-second chair stand test (lower body strength)
- Single-leg balance test (stability and fall risk)
- Resting heart rate (cardiovascular fitness)
- Waist-to-height ratio (health risk indicator)
- Physical activity levels (WHO guidelines)
